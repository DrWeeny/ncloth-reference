<h1>nCloth </h1>
<p>The idea of nCloth is having a<strong> nMesh</strong> (ex. shirt) colliding against a <strong>passive Collider</strong> (ex. skin) for simulate realistic cloth behaviour.</p>
<p>Nucleus Cloth is a stable system of<strong> linked particles</strong> to simulate a wide variety of polygon surfaces.<br />
  This network of particles is connected by  links, which together create a dynamic mesh. <br />
  <span class="bold">Links</span> mantain  the distance between particles, and<span class="bold"> cross-links</span> mantain  the angle between links, stabilizing the nCloth and preventing cloth behavior like shearing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remember,<strong> cross links</strong> are only generated for quads, not triangles</li>
  <li>At each<strong> vertex </strong>a particle will be created and at each <strong>edge</strong> a link</li>
  <li>nCloth collide with surfaces, with itself, and can also collide with particles</li>
  <li>nCloth can only be made of<strong> polygons</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>CREATE NCLOTH
</h2>
<p>For create a cloth mesh around a character, select it and <strong>nMesh&gt; Create nCloth</strong><br />
In the option box you have 2 options:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Local Space Output:</strong> the duplicated nCloth will be in the same group (transform node) as the original mesh, meaning<br />
    that if you move one, you will move the other one too. </li>
  <li><strong>World Space Output: </strong>the nCloth will be in a different transform node, so for example you can move the nCloth in a different position, but the simulation still wont change, or you can even scale it up. This is the option you wanna use for<strong> cache.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, after assigning an nCloth you might gonna loose textures or fur, which you can easily assign again.</p>
<p><span class="Attention">Important</span> You can<span class="bold"> smooth</span> the nCloth for render, however, the increased resolution will not have any effect on any calculations, for they are done directly from the original mesh, not the nCloth</p>
<h2>create a passive collider</h2>
<p>select an object against which an ncloth should collide and <strong>nMesh&gt; Create Passive Collider</strong></p>
<h2>Nucleus </h2>
<p>is the heart of all n calculations, if you select a nMesh, in its AE the last node is the nucleus.<br />

No history of vertex cross-over or geometry                             flipping is used to solve Bend Resistance. Use either High                                Quality or Flip Tracking for nCloth                             simulations where vertices may cross-over or the geometry flips.                             Otherwise, Maya may bend the nCloth surface in the wrong direction,                             causing jittering motion and poor self-collisions.</li>
      <li><strong>High Quality</strong>, solves Bend                                Resistance each step based on the relative position of                             the nCloth vertices. When solving Bend Resistance, High                                Quality keeps a history of instances when vertices cross-over and                             geometry has flipped around itself. This history is maintained for                             the duration of a simulation step. At the end of each simulation step,                             Maya assumes that all vertex cross-over and geometry flipping are                             resolved and the history is cleared. With no instances of nCloth surfaces                             bent around itself, meaning no flipping, collisions are properly                             resolved. High                                Quality resolves poor collisions due to instances of                             vertex cross-over and geometry flipping without producing kinks                             in the output mesh. By default Bend Solver is                             set to High Quality. </li>
      <li><strong>Flip Tracking</strong>, solves Bend                                Resistance each step based on the relative position of                             the nCloth vertices. When solving Bend Resistance, Flip                                Tracking keeps a running history of instances when vertices cross-over                             and geometry has flipped around itself. This history is maintained                             for the duration of the simulation. Using Flip Tracking lets                             you solve nCloth surfaces that may bend around themselves several                             times like a spring and then unwind during the simulation. Be aware that if the                             surface winds a number of times during the simulation, kinks may                             appear in the resulting surface, particularly in areas where winding                             has caused poor collisions. If your nCloth is winding excessively                             during a simulation or kinks appear in the output mesh, use the High                                Quality option. Flip Tracking is                             the default Bend Solver method used in                             previous versions of Maya. </li>

A value                          of 1 pushes objects out in one step, while lower values push out                          in more steps but provide smoother results.

<h2>Apply fields</h2>
<p>Just like with particles, you can apply any field by selecting the nCloth and <strong>Field&gt; ....</strong></p>
<h2>Play every frame</h2>
<p>in maya preferences make sure to activate <strong>play every frame</strong> for allow nCloth to be correctly calculated.</p>
<h2>Smoothing mesh</h2>
<p>After a nCloth simulation you can smooth the geometry for render, however the object will still behave the same, no more vertices were added to the dynamic calculations. If you want high details for the geometry calculation you have to smooth it before creating the nCloth</p>
<h2>Disable nDynamics calculations</h2>
<p>When you want to work on keyframing a character without working on nCloth, you can disable it for faster playback.<br />
  <strong>Modify&gt; Evaluate Nodes&gt; Nuclei</strong>, this will ignore all nDynamics calculations.</p>
<h1>nconstraint</h1>
<p>Used for constraint components of an nCloth to components of any other geometry, nCloth, Passive Collider or even a normal polygon. Remember that wether you select faces, edges or vertices, the constraint is always done to the vertices.</p>

<h2>Set a new initial state</h2>
<p>You can set a specific keyframe to be the inital shape of the nCloth, for example, once a nCloth blanquet has fallen on the sofa you want to use this new position as the beginning one, so:</p>
<ul>
  <li>select the nCloth</li>
  <li>nSolver&gt; Initial State&gt;<strong> Set From Current</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Relax Initial State</h2>
<p>select the nCloth and<strong> nSolver&gt; Initial State&gt; Relax Initial State<br />
</strong>Doing so will simulate a number of iterations for the cloth and resave its initial state.</p>
<h2>Interactive playback</h2>
<p><strong>nSolver&gt; Interactive Playback </strong>allows you to test nCloths without setting keyframes, basically once you turn on this feauture you can just move a passive collider into the nCloth for see its effect. </p>
<h2>Input mesh vs. Current mesh</h2>
<p>When you create an nCloth maya will duplicate the polygon and use the original one for calculate the position of the nCloth mesh.If you want to go back to see the original mesh, what you have to do is select the nCloth and nMesh&gt;<strong> Display Input Mesh.</strong><br />
  What happens is that you will see the non-deformable original mesh, for go back and see again the deformed mesh select it and <strong>nMesh&gt; Display Current Mesh</strong> </p>
<h2>Use different solvers</h2>
<p>By default, all nCloth calculations are done by one solver, however, you can create a new solver and apply it to specific nCloths with these reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For safe calculations, you want to isolate some nCloth from others that you know they are never gonna collide with each other.</li>
  <li>You can adjust solver's properties on very specific objects, for example, if you have a very high detailed blanquet colliding with a character you<br />
    can use a very accurate solver for it. For other simple calculations within the scene you can use an less heavy solver.</li>
  <li>You can keyframe solver attributes, for example you can decrease its accuracy when the nMesh is not colliding, and increase it on keyframe with lots of accuracy needed. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Solver&gt; AE Display</h2>
<p>lets you choose which properties you are going to see in the Attributes Editor, for example, shader are not visible by default.<br />
The options are: <strong>dynamicConstrai Nodes, Material Nodes, nComponent Nodes, Property Maps, Transforms </strong>and <strong>other non-nucleus nodes.</strong></p>
<h2><br />
  Caching</h2>
<p>nCloth caches only store the XYZ positions of an nCloth object's vertices, not the translation, rotation, or scale of the nCloth's Transform node.<br />
  Then cache will be safed in the project folder inside <strong>Data</strong> folder.</p>
<ol>
  <li>select the <strong>nCloth</strong></li>
  <li><strong>nCache&gt; Create New Cache</strong></li>
  <li>press <strong>Esc</strong> key for interupt the simulation</li>
  <li><strong>Disable Nuclesb </strong> now that you don't need it anymore.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can<strong> delete </strong>the cache for simulate again with nCloth by <strong>nCache&gt; Delete Cache</strong>, remember that you can keep the cache file in your<br />
  folder and reuse them in future. </p>
<h2>Bake to polygon</h2>
<p>If you want to detach the mesh from the simulation for render a still image (and want to move some vertex) you simply <strong>duplicate</strong> the mesh (<strong>Ctrl D</strong>), this new polygon will not have any link to the Nucleus.</p>
